# Neural Networks
Study of using neural network for applying to customer credit checking.  This data uses the NeurophStudio tool to test out the various neural networks.

There are simple binary input neural networks, one with a single layer and the other with two layers, as well as single layer containing 6 inputs.  Different types of input data was used to see how these networks would respond.  

For the binary input networks, the binary values specified reflect discrete conditions that either result in a 1 or 0.  For example, is the customer charging more than $10000?  If so, then the value would be 1, otherwise it would be 0.  Another option would be whether the customer is a "preferred" customer to which extended credit should be allowed?

The other data has actual amount values to represent the amount the customer is buying and the amount of credit the customer already has.
